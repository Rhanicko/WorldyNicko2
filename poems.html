                            A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

                            <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
                            Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

                            <p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
                            But only God can make a tree.</p>

                            In a beautiful pea-green boat,<br>
                            They took some honey, and plenty of money,<br>
                            Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</p>

                            <p>The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
                            And sang to a small guitar,<br>
                            "O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,<br>
                            What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
                            You are, You are!<br>
                            What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</p>

                            <p>Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!<br>
                            How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
                            O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br>
                            But what shall we do for a ring?"</p>

                            <p>They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
                            To the land where the Bong-Tree grows<br>
                            And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br>
                            With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
                            His nose, His nose,<br>
                            With a ring at the end of his nose.</p>

                            Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing<br>
                            Ever a child can do!</p>

                            <p>Up in the air and over the wall,<br>
                            Till I can see so wide,<br>
                            Rivers and trees and cattle and all<br>
                            Over the countryside—</p>

                            <p>Till I look down on the garden green,<br>
                            Down on the roof so brown—<br>
                            Up in the air I go flying again,<br>
                            Up in the air and down!</p>
